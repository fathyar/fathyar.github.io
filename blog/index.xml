This is useful in cases where some data in the metadata is irrelevant to be displayed.

That the existence of &amp;ldquo;Cheat sheets&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; page type in this blog is redundant. It makes me feel like something is not right. I need to clear this up. So, do I need to pick one, or keep them both? I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll go for &amp;ldquo;cheat sheet&amp;rdquo; if I need to pick one. Here&amp;rsquo;s my argument. &amp;ldquo;Snippets&amp;rdquo; can be included in cheat sheets.</description></item><item><title>Introducing My Hugo Theme, Elementary</title><link>https://fathyar.github.io/blog/2021/08/introducing-my-hugo-theme-elementary/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 08:19:08 +0700</pubDate><guid>https://fathyar.github.io/blog/2021/08/introducing-my-hugo-theme-elementary/</guid><description>Elementary is a Hugo theme I created for my blog, this very blog.
